# GitHub tutorial for the Rhone group https://materials-intelligence.com/

## Motivation
Everyone in the Rhone group codes. Most of us started with Professor Rhone's onboarding exercise, which is the content of this repository. One day, let's say we get a very nice score on magnetic moment using RandomForestRegressor. We may want to keep the correspond set of descriptors, hyperparameters, and even better, the current stage of our notebook/colab. But at the same time, also want to modify the program to achieve a better score. 

One option is to make a copy of the code. We will have `ML_2D_exercises.ipynb` and `ML_2D_exercises.ipynb(1).ipynb` in our folder. If another change is made, we will have `ML_2D_exercises.ipynb(2).ipynb`, `ML_2D_exercises.ipynb(3).ipynb`, and so on. This can become overwhelming due to the ever-increasing number of files in our folder. Also, a week later, one may have trouble remembering which file, `ML_2D_exercises.ipynb(2).ipynb` or `ML_2D_exercises.ipynb(3).ipynb` contains the better result.

On the other hand, if we only keep one copy and make a mistake, we might need to press `Ctrl + C` or `Command + C` many times to get back the stage that was working, and there is no guarantee we will.

The solution is GitHub https://github.com/, and more fundamentally, **git** https://git-scm.com/.
